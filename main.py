# Define a Card class

# Define a Deck Class

# Implement the shuffle() operation
    # Must return no value
    # Results in cards in the deck being randomly permuted
    # Do NOT use the library-provided shuffle function
    # Do use the library-provided random number generator

# Implement the dealOneCard() operation
    # Returns one card from the deck to the caller
    # A call to shuffle mused be followed by 52 calls to dealOneCard()
    # this should result in the caller being provided all 52 cards of the deck in a random order
    # if the caller makes a 53rd call to dealOneCard(), the caller should receive None

# Must implement the principle of least surprise

# Add security checks to ensure that the code meets the requirements for Appian's security standards
